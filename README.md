# BidSphere - Auction Management System MVP

This is a basic MVP layout for the BidSphere Auction Management System.

## Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML structure.
- `style.css`: Minimal CSS styling.

## How to Run
Simply open `index.html` in any web browser.

## Design Decisions
- **Minimalist**: White background with light grey accents for a clean, professional look.
- **Responsive**: Flexbox used for layout to ensure it adapts reasonably well (though optimized for desktop view as per MVP instructions).
- **No External Dependencies**: Pure HTML/CSS for simplicity and speed.
